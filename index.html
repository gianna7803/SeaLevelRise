          <p>“Sea levels are rising”: a phrase heard by anyone who has been watching the news the past forty years or so. But recent research has shown that levels are rising at an even faster rate than they were previously. As per the United States Environmental Protection Agency, sea levels rose at a steady rate of 0.06 inches per year since 1880. But starting in 1993, levels have risen 0.12-0.14 inches per year – which is more than twice as fast as the trend. </p>
          <p>This has detrimental effects on the Earth, one being on coastal towns and cities. As the decades go by, beaches will become larger and larger, until the ocean eventually takes over these towns entirely. At the current rate, cities on major bodies of water – like New York City and Chicago – will be underwater within the next century. Another thing majorly affected by sea level rise is marine life. Higher levels will increase the space between coral reefs and the surface, which reduces light penetration that is necessary for their survival (2). Coral reefs are major parts of the marine ecosystem, housing thousands of species of fish and providing oxygen for every single underwater animal.</p>
          <p>So what are the causes of sea level rise? And how can we as a society stop or, at least, delay it?</p>

            <p>With fossil fuels and greenhouse gasses filling our atmosphere essentially every day for the past three hundred years, there's no true “detoxing” to be done. When released into the air, greenhouse gasses trap heat and raise the temperature (1). In the winter of 2016, the temperature was 4.55°F above average. Last winter, the temperature was 1.9°F over average. While it seems to be getting slightly better, any rise in temperature has damaging effects on things like agriculture and the weather.</p>

            <p>Since the start of the second industrial revolution, fossil fuels have plagued our Earth’s atmosphere. Industrialization and mass production, while great technological advances for our society, were the foundation for a soon-deteriorating environment. Greenhouse gas emissions, made from the burning of fossil fuels (1), have had detrimental effects on our planet. Since 1990, the U.S. has released over 170,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Not only is this toxic for humans, but it’s toxic for animals and plants – our only sources of food and oxygen. And the constant flow of gasses and fuels into the air not only heats our planet, but destroys it.</p>

            <p>With temperatures rising, and winter’s not as cold, our planet's snow and ice caps are deplenishing by the second. In just 163 years, our global mass of glaciers dropped 27.4 meters. That means every single glacier on Earth has decreased by almost 30 meters. That is the same size as a stretch limousine, or an adult blue whale. Sea levels are rising directly due to the melting of glaciers, whereas the other two causes here are the reasoning for the glaciers melting themselves.</p>

        <p>With the facts staring us in the face, it’s hard not to be pessimistic about the future of the Earth. So is it too late for us? Dominic Wilkins doesn’t think so.</p>
        <p>Wilkins, 27, is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Geography and the Environment at Syracuse University. Wilkins explains that climate change is not a “binary choice”, so we as a society must determine what type or degree of climate change that our planet will experience. In terms of what needs to be done immediately, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is on top of the list.  Wilkins says we can do this by transitioning to clean energy sources, such as solar panels, and “ceasing the destruction of carbon sinks” – which are things that absorb more carbon than they release (like trees and glaciers). But how do we take these steps?</p>
        <p>“We need to change how we produce energy, we need to change how we produce food, we need to change how we move around, we need to change how we distribute the burdens associated with addressing socio-ecological transformation, change how we distribute power, and fundamentally change how we (considered individually and collectively) live—and we need to do all of that at once,” says Wilkins.</p>
        <p>While hefty tasks, these are essential to create and sustain a safe and healthy world for ourselves and future generations.</p>
